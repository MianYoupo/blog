# Hello

**My name is Mian Youpo.**

I am a front-end developer currently based in shanghai and mainly use [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) as my  JavaScript framework

I studied civil engineering in college and  switching into front-end development after graduating, honestly, the process was toughðŸ˜¥

I blogged some notes and some other stuff, it might be a little confusingðŸ˜“

Outside of programming, I enjoy hiking and watching anime
